The system supports an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor or a custom infrared sensor for detecting the presence of mail. Features include Wi-Fi network connectivity and provisioning via Wi-Fi Easy Connect (DPP). System management and user notifications are handled through a web application. The system is power-efficient when powered by a battery and supports deep sleep mode.
